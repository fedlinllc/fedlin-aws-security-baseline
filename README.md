## 🎯 What This Delivers

A comprehensive security baseline for AWS environments preparing for compliance audits or requiring repeatable security hardening.

**Designed for:**
- **Compliance teams** preparing for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, NIST (CSF/800-53), PCI DSS, NERC CIP, FERC, FedRAMP, GDPR, CMMC, or other industry framework assessments
- **Organizations** needing automated security controls with audit-ready evidence
- **MSPs/MSSPs** requiring standardized security deployment across client accounts
- **Security teams** implementing AWS security best practices at scale

**Key capabilities:**
- Core AWS security services enabled (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config, CloudTrail)
- 40-60 automated compliance checks mapped to regulatory frameworks
- Multi-region security coverage
- OIDC-only deployment (zero long-lived credentials)
- Customer-retained evidence and logs

## 🔒 Customer-Tenant-First Architecture

All security controls and evidence remain in your AWS account:

**Evidence stays with you:**
- CloudTrail logs in your S3 buckets (encrypted, versioned)
- Config snapshots and evaluations in your account
- GuardDuty findings in your Security Hub
- CloudWatch logs under your control
- Complete data sovereignty

**FEDLIN deployment approach:**
- Infrastructure deployed via Terraform in your AWS account
- GitHub Actions with OIDC (no long-lived credentials stored)
- One-time setup, you maintain ongoing access
- Can be removed cleanly with standard Terraform destroy

**Benefits for regulated environments:**
- Satisfies data residency requirements
- Simplifies vendor risk assessments
- Supports SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, NIST (CSF/800-53), PCI DSS, NERC CIP, FERC, FedRAMP, GDPR, CMMC, and other industry framework evidence expectations
- No ongoing data processing agreements beyond initial deployment

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Healthcare SaaS SOC 2 Preparation

**Challenge:** First SOC 2 Type II audit, 8-week timeline, limited security team  
**Solution:** Deployed security baseline across 4 AWS accounts in 4 days  
**Outcome:** Passed audit with zero security findings, automated evidence collection

### MSP Multi-Tenant Standardization

**Challenge:** Inconsistent security posture across 15 client AWS accounts  
**Solution:** Standardized baseline with OIDC automation, per-customer evidence isolation  
**Outcome:** Deployment time reduced from 2 weeks to 1 day per customer

### Federal Subcontractor Engagement

**Challenge:** Prime contractor needed AWS hardening, customer must own all data  
**Solution:** Customer-tenant-first model deployed in AWS GovCloud  
**Outcome:** Clean subcontractor relationship, customer passed FedRAMP-equivalent assessment

## 💻 Infrastructure Efficiency

**Typical AWS costs:**
- Small accounts (< 50 resources): $30-80/month
- Medium accounts (50-500 resources): $80-200/month  
- Large accounts (500+ resources): $200-500/month
- Cost varies based on CloudTrail volume, Config rules, GuardDuty findings

**Deployment metrics:**
- Terraform resources: 80-120 (depends on modules enabled)
- Deployment time: 3-5 business days post-access
- Config rules: 40-60 automated checks
- Evidence retention: 7 years (configurable)
